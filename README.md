# ICAD

Seeing the current rate at which the number of cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) are increasing, there has to be a dashboard that displays the number of COVID cases in a region along with their precise locations. 

The aim is to build India Covid Awareness Dashboard (ICAD) that makes people aware about the COVID situation in and around their state and country. There will also be contact information about the hospitals and help desks that serve COVID patients. This is very important as most people suffering from COVID donâ€™t know where to look for numbers and whom to call.
